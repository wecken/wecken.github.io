      "Since I've never designed for E-commerce app, I did a lot of researches on major EC web sites, and apps such as Amazon, Rakuten, Mercari, etc. Not only the EC apps, but I also researched design of popular sweets brands' web sites such as BAKE, Mr. Cheesecake, etc because our main product lineups were sweets.",
    kurashiru_store_article_paragraph_02:
      "This project was also where I learned designing banners, or other creative works. As EC service, the UI that just works is not enough, but we needed to sell products. Therefore, various methods for communicating with customers were needed. I created many banners in different sizes and forms to attract customers, and make our products look great.",
    kurashiru_store_article_paragraph_03:
      "I started with designing the product description page first because we offered very few number of items in the beginning, which made the collection page or category page not so important.",
    kurashiru_store_article_paragraph_04:
      "I also designed sign up flow very carefully because it's the one where users are most likely to drop out and end up not converting. One of the most important feature was that customer could actually put the item in the cart without having an account. This strategy was very successful because (I assume) once the customer puts itmes into the cart, creating account and entering forms seem to be very natural. If we asked creating account before customer start interacting with our services, many of them would have dropped out earlier. To achieve this, the logic behind the scene is pretty complex as you can see the image above. However, from customer point of view, the design was very clean and simple.",
    mbux_article_paragraph_01:
      "When I joinded the company, the product was catastrophic. Even in the production release, the entire system constantly kept crashing, which, as a matter of course, resulted a number of customer complaints. First, I had to find out why that situation was happening. The biggest problem I found was too many 'Japan-specific' features. Due to historical reason, Japanese GPS navigation system evoloved in peculiar way. Therefore, the product and the process of development have been so much complicated. I had to align the Japan-specific UI to global UI Design Strategy asking myself 'are these features really necessary?'. To find out, I conducted an online survey. I asked Japanese users how often they use such features. As a result, I found a lot of them were not used      anymore. Therefore, I reduced a number of features that were 'over-localized'. This resulted significant improvements of system stability, and it allowed me to import many advanced features that were standard in other countries.",

    mbux_article_paragraph_03:
      "Previous generation was featuring address input method where user had to choose destination address step by step from state (a.k.a prefecture) to street number. This feature was unique to Japanese market. However, this method was ineficient. It took about 90 seconds to input average Japanese address. Therefore, I redesigned the interaction flow so user can immediately start typing the destination, which accepts many types of keywords like address, POI name, POI category, POI phone number, and ZIP code, using software keyboard. With the new concept I designed, it took just 10 seconds to complete the same address, making it 9 times faster than previous generation. Because the keyboard allows voice input as well, user can input the address even safer and faster while driving.",
    mbux_article_paragraph_04:
      "I didn't just cut features. By reducing unimportant functions, we were able to develop localized functions that we should have focused on. One such feature is flick input.",
    mbux_article_paragraph_05:
      "Flick input was already a very popular text input method for mobile phones in Japan at that time. However, we were only offering old-fashioned 50-key input method that you might see in the very user-unfriendly touch panel system in city office, for example.",

      "Before I redesigned it, there were too many screen transitions making the app feel like inneficient to use. Because the app is famous for the amount of example sentenses, I wanted the app to be more efficient when user is searching for a best suitable result from many of those.",

    netsuper_article_paragraph_01:
      "The first challange that is unique to online grocery is that the number of items. There are max 40,000 items listed on one of our partner's online stores. Another thing is that users add much more items to the cart with a single purchase compared to regular ECs like Amazon. On regular ECs, users will purchase 1 or 2 items together, but on online grocery ECs it is common to buy 20 to 40 items in a single cart. In other words, it is very important that the operation from finding the product to adding it to the cart is efficient.",
    netsuper_article_paragraph_02:
      "My approach to this challenge was to carefully design the category navigation experience. If you imagine yourself in the supermarket and finding the stuff you need, you should be locating yourself in your mind to find where those can be found.  Or, you will be walking isle by isle to get reminded or inspired of what you wanted to buy.",
